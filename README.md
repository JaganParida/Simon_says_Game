# Simon Says Game ðŸŽ®

## Overview

**Simon Says** is a classic memory-based game where players must follow commands prefixed with **"Simon says."** If an instruction lacks "Simon says," players should ignore it. Making a mistake results in elimination. The game tests memory and reflexes by progressively increasing difficulty as the player advances.

1. **Click on the display area (except the four colored boxes) to start the game.**
2. One of the four boxes will flash for a second.
3. Remember the sequence and click the corresponding box for **Level 1.**
